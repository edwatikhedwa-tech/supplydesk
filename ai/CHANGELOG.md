## 2026-08-30T16:20:16Z — AUDIT — TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830

- Agent: `Codex`
- Task ID: `TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830`
- Mode: `AUDIT`
- Action: inspected repository root, Git branch/commit/status/remote, agent instructions, project state documents, runtime listener and declared commands.
- Files: existing `CLAUDE.md`, `Documents/28-8/PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `Documents/28-8/PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `frontend/package.json`, `vercel.json`, source/runtime metadata.
- Result: audit complete; worktree is dirty with pre-existing application changes; no origin configured; local `127.0.0.1:8000` answered 200 for `/` and `/api/auth/me`.
- Evidence: read-only PowerShell/Git inspection recorded in `ai/reports/TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830-AUDIT.md`.
- Commit: `7658b1151bab414c867bf87898003586fbcdc8f3` baseline.
- Status: `PASS`

## 2026-08-30T16:20:16Z — DESIGN DECISION — TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830

- Agent: `Codex`
- Task ID: `TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830`
- Mode: `DESIGN DECISION`
- Action: selected a repository-local `ai/` control plane, preserved useful `CLAUDE.md` root-hygiene rules, created a Codex branch, and excluded application files.
- Files: branch metadata; no application files.
- Result: scope fixed to state documents, adapters, templates, report and read-only validator.
- Evidence: `ai/WORKFLOW.md` and `ai/DECISIONS.md`.
- Commit: `HEAD` at close.
- Status: `PASS`

## 2026-08-30T16:20:16Z — IMPLEMENT — TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830

- Agent: `Codex`
- Task ID: `TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830`
- Mode: `IMPLEMENT`
- Action: created the unified state-document structure and updated root agent adapters.
- Files: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ai/` documentation tree.
- Result: implementation created; validator and final acceptance still pending.
- Evidence: file existence and later validator output.
- Commit: `HEAD` at close.
- Status: `PARTIAL`

## 2026-08-30T16:30:02Z — ACCEPTANCE — TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830

- Agent: `Codex`
- Task ID: `TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830`
- Mode: `ACCEPTANCE`
- Action: ran the read-only validator, Python compilation, backend unittest suite, HTTP smoke/error checks and scoped documentation checks.
- Files: `ai/tools/validate_state.py`, `ai/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
- Result: validator PASS; compile PASS; 344 tests OK with 1 PostgreSQL skip; `/` 200; `/api/auth/me` 200; invalid API path 404.
- Evidence: command output from this acceptance run; PostgreSQL skip is due to missing configured PostgreSQL URL.
- Commit: `HEAD` at close.
- Status: `PASS`

## 2026-08-30T16:30:02Z — CLOSE — TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830

- Agent: `Codex`
- Task ID: `TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830`
- Mode: `CLOSE`
- Action: closed the documentation/state iteration, cleared `ACTIVE_TASK.md` to the idle sentinel, prepared the scoped Task-ID commit and confirmed that no push is possible.
- Files: `ai/ACTIVE_TASK.md`, `ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `ai/LAST_HANDOFF.md`, `ai/INTERACTION_LOG.md`, `ai/reports/TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830-FINAL.md`.
- Result: no application file entered the allowed scope; working tree remains dirty only because of pre-existing user changes plus the pending scoped commit.
- Evidence: scoped `git status`, `git diff --check`, validator PASS and final report.
- Commit: `HEAD` after the scoped commit; exact hash is reported by final `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- Status: `PASS`

## 2026-08-30T16:34:45Z — COMMIT — TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830

- Agent: `Codex`
- Task ID: `TASK-STATE-CONTROL-20260830`
- Mode: `CLOSE`
- Action: verified and recorded the scoped documentation commit; preserved pre-existing staged files outside the Task ID.
- Files: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ai/**` only.
- Result: local commit exists; no push attempted because `origin` is absent.
- Evidence: `git rev-parse HEAD`, `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD`, validator PASS.
- Commit: `HEAD` — exact hash reported after this final chronology update.
- Status: `PASS`
